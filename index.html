        <div class="subheading mb-5">Business EconomicsðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Yamileth Monarrez, and I am a first year undergraduate student at UCR. My current major is Business Economics, however I plan on changing it to Psychology. I want to be a criminal psychologist in the future, due to my interest in serial killers. Throughout High School, I derived this fascination and interest in the way that a serial killerâ€™s mind functions. I want to study their behaviors and understand their motives for committing such heinous crimes. This particular subject caught my interest when one of my best friends and I decided to research serial killers for weeks. When projects of my choice would come up, I would always choose serial killers, and one of my favorite ones was the history of serial killers, which is the one that allowed me to make a career choice, and has then influenced me into watching a lot of criminal justice and forensic shows.<br><br>

        Apart from my interests regarding my major and career choice, I have other things that I enjoy doing. One of my favorite sports to watch and play is soccer. I also enjoy volleyball and cheerleading. However, soccer is at the top of the list. Soccer is my escape from all of my problems and from any negativity in my life. It has allowed me to remain sane and healthy, as well as fit. I have put a lot of time and effort into becoming a better player in the sport I love. From sweat, to tears, to anger, to fights, I have remained loyal to this sport my entire life. Other than sports, I love eating. Because I enjoy eating so much, I began cooking and baking. I like to try out new recipes and see how they turn out. I get a lot of requests to make certain dishes and pastries, and I thought about going into the food industry as a career choice, but I heard it was expensive to go into culinary school, so I decided not to. All I am going to say is that I make some delicious BBQ-Ribs.<br><br>

        One of my goals in life is to travel around the world and visit some of the most beautiful places. During these travels, I also have a goal of visiting every Disney park in the world. I want to graduate with a PhD in the future, which is something that nobody in my family has ever done. I am very determined to achieve all of my goals and to be successful in the future. I am hoping that by attending UCR, I can take the steps necessary to accomplish all of this. I do not only plan on attending UCR. I hope I can transfer to the University of Washington later on for a different learning experience, both academic and personal. If UCR can be the head start for my career, then it is something that I will greatly appreciate as I progress in my journey for a successful future.
